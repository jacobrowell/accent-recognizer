# accent-recognizer

This is a prototype of an accent recognition system.

I made this as my bachelor graduate work. The thing is still WIP.

## Implementation

This is made with Python 2.7 using [scikits.talkbox](https://github.com/cournape/talkbox)

## Usage

Install all the requirements and you're ready to go - just run main.py.

```
git clone https://github.com/KristobalJunta/accent-recognizer.git
cd accent-recognizer
python2 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python2 main.py
```
